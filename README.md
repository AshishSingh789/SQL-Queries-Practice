# Hotel Reservation Analysis with SQL

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of **SQL** to analyze a hotel reservation dataset. The dataset provides insights into guest preferences, booking trends, and other critical factors that impact hotel operations. Through solving a series of 15 SQL-based questions, I explored various aspects of data analysis, such as aggregate functions, grouping, filtering, and more.

## Dataset Details

The dataset includes the following columns:

- **Booking_ID**: A unique identifier for each hotel reservation.
- **no_of_adults**: The number of adults in the reservation.
- **no_of_children**: The number of children in the reservation.
- **no_of_weekend_nights**: The number of nights in the reservation that fall on weekends.
- **no_of_week_nights**: The number of nights in the reservation that fall on weekdays.
- **type_of_meal_plan**: The meal plan chosen by the guests.
- **room_type_reserved**: The type of room reserved by the guests.
- **lead_time**: The number of days between booking and arrival.
- **arrival_date**: The date of arrival.
- **market_segment_type**: The market segment to which the reservation belongs.
- **avg_price_per_room**: The average price per room in the reservation.
- **booking_status**: The status of the booking (e.g., Confirmed, Canceled).

## Questions Solved

1. Total number of reservations in the dataset.
2. Most popular meal plan among guests.
3. Average price per room for reservations involving children.
4. Number of reservations made in a specific year.
5. Most commonly booked room type.
6. Reservations with at least one weekend night.
7. Highest and lowest lead times for reservations.
8. Most common market segment type for reservations.
9. Total number of confirmed reservations.
10. Total number of adults and children across all reservations.
11. Average number of weekend nights for reservations involving children.
12. Number of reservations made in each month of the year.
13. Average number of nights (weekend and weekday) spent by guests for each room type.
14. Most common room type and its average price for reservations involving children.
15. Market segment type generating the highest average price per room.

## What You'll Learn

- **SQL Fundamentals**: Writing basic to intermediate-level SQL queries.
- **Data Aggregation**: Using `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, and other aggregate functions.
- **Filtering**: Utilizing `WHERE` clauses to filter data.
- **Grouping and Sorting**: Mastering `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` to organize data insights.
- **Date and String Functions**: Extracting and manipulating data effectively.

## Tools Used

- SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite)
- Hotel reservation dataset (provided in the project)

## Conclusion

This project showcases the application of SQL in analyzing real-world data. It helped enhance my understanding of data manipulation, aggregation, and querying techniques. The insights gained can be instrumental for decision-making in the hotel industry.
